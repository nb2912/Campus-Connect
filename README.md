## 💡 The Problem
Campus life can be expensive and isolating.
* **High Travel Costs:** A cab to the airport costs ₹1,200+. Splitting it lowers the cost to ₹300.
* **Wasted Money:** Delivery fees on individual food orders add up quickly.
* **Coordination Chaos:** Finding a gym spotter or a hackathon teammate usually involves spamming random WhatsApp groups.
* **Safety Concerns:** Traveling with strangers from open platforms is risky.

## ⚡ The Solution
**SRM Social** provides a unified, verified, and real-time dashboard where students can find peers for specific needs instantly. By restricting access to verified university emails, we ensure a safe and trusted environment.
